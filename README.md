# Setup Example

Showing some setup that is needed for adding jest, testing-library, some eslint configs and also some pre/push tasks using husky/lint-staged

### inspired by Ken C. Dodds Javascript Testing

#### Eslint

Eslinting happens on hooks locally by running either
`npm run lint`
or automatically if a husky hook is enabled via `.huskyrc` file
